  - [x] Create menu application to list, choose, run (by fork + exec), and come back to list for the programs.
  - [x] Close stdin/stdout for user processes, and open appropriate files
  - [x] Redirect information to and from client to process

#### Client
  - [x] Get terminal size
  - [ ] Initial connection, save session id.
  - [ ] Buffer keypresses, send to server occasionally
  - [ ] Display output
  - [ ] If the response completely filled the buffer, make another request immediately following.

#### Applications
